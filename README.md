# Colas Garage Valet Driver

This driver is to make Colas Garage working on local machine using valet.
The idea is just to repointing default index.php to controller.php. If
you're using another, just do the pointing to the right folder and right
file "controller.php".

To use this, just copy the `ColasValetDriver` to correct valet folder.
